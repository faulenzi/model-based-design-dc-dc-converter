# Model-Based Design for a SEPIC

## Special Instructions
In this reference example we will use a SEPIC circuit topology to show how to model and simulate a DC-DC converter that powers an LED display.  Using Simulink and Simscape Electrical, you can show how to analyze, develop, simulate, and implement a controller that maintains desired output voltage in the presence of input voltage variations and load changes to achieve fast and stable response. The demonstration will includes generating embedded code from the control algorithms suitable for implementing on a microcontroller. Part of this example can be executed without hardware. Using the standard HIL TI C2000 board available with the off-the-sheld HIL Speedgoat kit, one can perform PIL simulations.
The complete example would require the TI TMDSDCDCLEDKIT available in the Swiss, Benelux and Netherland office.
